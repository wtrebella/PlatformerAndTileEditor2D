Platformer and TileEditor2D
==========

This is just a way to hopefully introduce you to the way a 2D platformer works in Unity 4.3. I'm still learning myself and I'm sure there are better ways to do some things. It's not even really a game at this point!

The Tile Editor I'm including in this is based on Chevy's TileEditor located here: http://unitypatterns.com/new-tool-tileeditor/. I just added 2D support.

His same quote applies: "Creating tile-based levels in Unity is much faster and easier with this tile editing extension, which allows you to place and delete tile prefabs on a grid with ease. When you want to find your way through your maze, the built-in pathfinding functionality will handle the navigation for you!"
